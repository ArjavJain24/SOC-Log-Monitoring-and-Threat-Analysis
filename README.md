# SOC Log Monitoring & Threat Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** workflow by analyzing authentication logs to detect suspicious activities such as brute-force login attempts and potential unauthorized access.

It demonstrates how SOC analysts monitor logs, classify incidents, and identify high-risk IP addresses.

## 📊 Sample Output
Total Failed Login Attempts: 3

192.168.1.10 -> Suspicious Activity Detected

## ⚙️ How It Works
- Parses authentication logs
- Extracts failed login attempts
- Counts repeated attempts per IP
- Flags IPs exceeding a defined threshold

---

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
cd scripts
python log_analyzer.py
