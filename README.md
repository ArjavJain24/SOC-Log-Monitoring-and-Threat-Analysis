# SOC Log Monitoring & Threat Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project simulates a **Security Operations Center (SOC)** workflow by analyzing authentication logs to detect suspicious activities such as brute-force login attempts and potential unauthorized access.

It demonstrates how SOC analysts monitor logs, classify incidents, and identify high-risk IP addresses.
